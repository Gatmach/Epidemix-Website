# Epidemix
> ` ` Agent-Based Modeling: `Meningitis` ` ` 

This is a project implementation using a `SIR`-like  model. Is extended to `SEIRs`:  

    - Susceptible
    - Exposed 
    - Infected
    - Recovered
    - etc  

---
## Model
> See the model of the project in the model [`model`](https://github.com/Joram-kireki/Epidemix/tree/{model})
 branch  
> Implemented in Python:- **Starsim**, **Django**, **Matplotlib**, etc.



### WHAT `Agent-Based Modeling` IS
> Extending **SIR** to **SEIRs**  

Think of Agent-Based Modeling as a system of computational models that simulate behavior of individual agents in order to study emergent phenomena - in terms of disease infection in a population. Agents may represent *humans, institutions, microorganisms*, and *disease vectors* and so forth. The agents’ actions are based on autonomous decision-making and other behavioral traits, implemented through formal rules of interaction in an environment.  
Agent-based modeling provides a unique lens through which complex systems can be examined and understood. This allows for manipulating numerous variables to create detailed scenarios, offering insights into how different vaccination strategies, and treatment might perform under various epidemiological and social conditions.
